# iPhone Contact Generator

This project will place 50 contacts into your iPhone's address book. Each contact will have a random phone number. Some contacts may or may not have a main number. All will have a mobile number.

I found this useful when having to test Address Book functionality in the iPhone simulator. I would not recommend running this on your iPhone 'cause it will delete all of your contacts.

Please let me know how this can be modified to be more useful.
